# fantasy_football_divisions

This code was written to perform simple math on the Points For (PF) scored in the previous fantasy football season, to determine the best combination of teams in a division.

Input.xlsx is manually copied data from the previous season.

main.py is the intialy code used to determine best Avergae, Median, and Standard Deviation, for the combination of teams

Median results in many possibilities, so 2 more programs were created to perform more operations:
    median_average.py combines the median approach first with the Average second
    median_stddev.py combines the median approach first with the Stand Deviation second

All programs will output data to console, as well as save the final divisions to Output.xlsx so user can save the file for later reference.
